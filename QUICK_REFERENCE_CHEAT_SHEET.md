## 💡 Key Concepts to Explain

### **LoRA in 30 seconds**
"LoRA decomposes weight updates into two low-rank matrices A and B. Instead of updating the full weight matrix W, we train only A and B where ΔW = BA. This reduces trainable parameters from billions to millions while maintaining effectiveness."

### **Why LoRA over Full Fine-tuning?**
1. **Memory**: 127x fewer trainable parameters
2. **Speed**: Faster training and convergence  
3. **Storage**: Tiny adapter files (MBs vs GBs)
4. **Modularity**: Swappable task-specific adapters
5. **Stability**: Preserves base model knowledge

### **4-bit Quantization Benefits**
- 4x memory reduction (16-bit → 4-bit)
- Minimal quality loss (<1% typically)
- Enables larger models on smaller GPUs
- Uses bitsandbytes library

## 🔍 Technical Deep Dives

### **LoRA Configuration Explanation**
```python
r=16,              # Rank: dimensionality of adaptation
lora_alpha=16,     # Scaling factor (typically = rank)
target_modules=[   # Where to apply LoRA:
    "q_proj",      # Query attention
    "k_proj",      # Key attention  
    "v_proj",      # Value attention
    "o_proj",      # Output attention
    "gate_proj",   # MLP gating
    "up_proj",     # MLP up-projection
    "down_proj"    # MLP down-projection
]
```

### **Training Optimization Strategy**
```python
per_device_train_batch_size=8,    # Small for memory
gradient_accumulation_steps=4,    # Maintain effective batch size 32
learning_rate=2e-4,              # Standard for LoRA
optim="adamw_8bit",              # Memory efficient optimizer
fp16=True,                       # Mixed precision training
gradient_checkpointing=True      # Trade compute for memory
```
