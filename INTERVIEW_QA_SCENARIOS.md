# Interview Q&A - Scenario-Based Questions

## ðŸŽ­ Behavioral & Scenario Questions

### **Scenario 1: Resource Constraints**
**Q: "What would you do if you had only a 8GB GPU instead of 16GB for this project?"**

**Your Answer:**
"I would implement several strategies:
1. **Reduce batch size to 1** with gradient accumulation of 16-32 steps
2. **Use smaller sequence length** (1024 instead of 2048 tokens)
3. **Consider TinyLlama or Gemma-2B** instead of Mistral-7B
4. **Implement gradient checkpointing** more aggressively
5. **Use FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel)** if available
6. **CPU offloading** for optimizer states
The key is maintaining training stability while working within memory limits."

### **Scenario 2: Production Deployment**
**Q: "A client wants to deploy your fine-tuned model in production. What considerations would you address?"**

**Your Answer:**
"Key production considerations:
1. **Merge LoRA weights** with base model for faster inference
2. **Quantize for serving** (GPTQ/AWQ) to reduce memory
3. **Set up monitoring** for performance drift and quality metrics
4. **Implement safety filters** for harmful content detection
5. **Create fallback mechanisms** if model fails
6. **Optimize serving infrastructure** with tools like vLLM
7. **A/B testing framework** to compare against baseline
8. **Cost optimization** through batching and caching strategies"

### **Scenario 3: Poor Results**
**Q: "What if your fine-tuned model performed worse than the base model?"**

**Your Answer:**
"I would systematically debug:
1. **Check data quality** - Look for formatting errors, corrupted examples
2. **Verify learning rate** - Too high causes instability, too low prevents learning
3. **Examine training curves** - Loss should decrease, check for overfitting
4. **Validate evaluation** - Ensure fair comparison with same prompts/settings
5. **Try different LoRA ranks** - 8, 32, 64 for comparison
6. **Increase dataset size** - 1500 examples might be insufficient
7. **Check target modules** - Maybe focus only on attention layers
8. **Experiment with regularization** - Add dropout, weight decay"

### **Scenario 4: Scaling Challenge**
**Q: "The client needs this model to handle 10 different languages. How would you approach this?"**

**Your Answer:**
"Multi-lingual adaptation strategy:
1. **Use multilingual dataset** like mC4 or translate Alpaca
2. **Language-specific LoRA adapters** - Train separate adapters per language
3. **Shared + specific architecture** - Common base LoRA + language-specific modules
4. **Cross-lingual evaluation** - Test on XNLI, XQuAD benchmarks
5. **Balance training data** across languages to prevent bias
6. **Consider multilingual base models** like mT5 or multilingual LLaMA
7. **Implement language detection** for adapter switching
8. **Monitor performance degradation** on original English tasks"

## ðŸ§  Technical Problem-Solving

### **Debugging Scenario 1: Memory Issues**
**Q: "During training, you get CUDA out of memory. Walk me through your debugging process."**

**Your Answer:**
```python
# Step 1: Check current memory usage
print(f"Allocated: {torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1024**3:.2f} GB")
print(f"Reserved: {torch.cuda.memory_reserved() / 1024**3:.2f} GB")

# Step 2: Clear cache and garbage collect
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
gc.collect()

# Step 3: Reduce batch size progressively
batch_sizes = [8, 4, 2, 1]
for bs in batch_sizes:
    try:
        # Update training args and retry
        break
    except torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError:
        continue

# Step 4: Implement gradient checkpointing
model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()

# Step 5: Consider model sharding or CPU offloading
```

### **Debugging Scenario 2: Training Instability**
**Q: "Your training loss starts at 2.5, drops to 1.8, then suddenly jumps to 15.0. What happened?"**

**Your Answer:**
"This indicates gradient explosion:
1. **Immediate action**: Implement gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)
2. **Root cause**: Learning rate likely too high for this stage
3. **Solution**: Reduce LR by 10x and restart from last good checkpoint
4. **Prevention**: Use warmup steps and cosine scheduling
5. **Monitoring**: Track gradient norms during training
6. **Alternative**: Switch to AdamW with lower beta2 (0.95 instead of 0.999)"

### **Performance Optimization Scenario**
**Q: "Training is taking too long. How would you speed it up without losing quality?"**

**Your Answer:**
"Optimization strategies:
1. **Increase batch size** with gradient accumulation if memory allows
2. **Use mixed precision** (FP16/BF16) for 2x speedup
3. **Enable torch.compile()** for PyTorch 2.0+ optimization
4. **Optimize data loading** - Use more workers, pin memory
5. **Implement packing** for short sequences (SFTTrainer packing=True)
6. **Use faster tokenizer** - Rust-based vs Python
7. **Profile code** to identify bottlenecks with torch.profiler
8. **Consider multi-GPU** with DDP if available"

## ðŸš€ Advanced Technical Discussions

### **Architecture Deep Dive**
**Q: "Explain why you targeted those specific modules (q_proj, k_proj, etc.) for LoRA."**

**Your Answer:**
"Strategic module selection:
1. **Attention projections (q,k,v,o)**: Control how model attends to information
2. **MLP layers (gate,up,down)**: Handle feature transformations and knowledge storage
3. **Skip embeddings**: Less critical for adaptation, frozen to preserve base knowledge
4. **Layer norms**: Frozen to maintain training stability
5. **Research evidence**: These modules shown most effective for adaptation
6. **Balance**: Enough expressiveness without too many parameters"

### **Mathematical Understanding**
**Q: "Derive the memory savings from using LoRA with rank 16 vs full fine-tuning."**

**Your Answer:**
```
Full fine-tuning parameters for attention:
- Q, K, V, O projections: 4 Ã— (4096 Ã— 4096) = 67M params per layer
- Total for 32 layers: 32 Ã— 67M = 2.14B parameters

LoRA parameters (rank 16):
- Each projection: (4096 Ã— 16) + (16 Ã— 4096) = 131K params
- 4 projections Ã— 32 layers: 4 Ã— 32 Ã— 131K = 16.8M parameters

Memory savings: 2.14B / 16.8M = 127x reduction in trainable parameters
```
