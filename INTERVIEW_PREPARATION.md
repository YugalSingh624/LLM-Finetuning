## üî• Core Interview Questions & Answers

### **1. "Tell me about your LLM fine-tuning project"**

**Your Answer:**
"I fine-tuned Mistral-7B using LoRA technique on the Alpaca instruction dataset. The goal was to improve the model's performance on reasoning tasks. I used a 4-bit quantized version to work within GPU memory constraints and achieved a 1.39% improvement in accuracy on the ARC-Easy benchmark, demonstrating that even small datasets can lead to measurable improvements when fine-tuning is done properly."

### **2. "Why did you choose LoRA over full fine-tuning?"**

**Your Answer:**
"LoRA was chosen for several practical reasons:
- **Memory Efficiency**: Fine-tuning a 7B model fully would require enormous GPU memory
- **Speed**: LoRA trains much faster by only updating low-rank matrices
- **Storage**: LoRA adapters are tiny (MBs vs GBs for full models)
- **Modularity**: Can switch between different LoRA adapters for different tasks
- **Stability**: Preserves the base model's knowledge while adapting to new tasks"

### **3. "Explain LoRA technique in detail"**

**Your Answer:**
"LoRA decomposes weight updates into two low-rank matrices A and B, where the update ŒîW = BA. Instead of updating the full weight matrix W, we only train A and B matrices. The key parameters are:
- **Rank (r)**: Dimensionality of the low-rank space (I used 16)
- **Alpha**: Scaling factor for the LoRA updates (I used 16)
- **Target Modules**: Which layers to apply LoRA to (I targeted attention and MLP layers)

This dramatically reduces trainable parameters from billions to just millions while maintaining effectiveness."

### **4. "What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?"**

**Your Answer:**
"Main challenges were:
1. **GPU Memory Limitations**: Solved with 4-bit quantization, small batch sizes, and gradient accumulation
2. **Training Stability**: Used gradient checkpointing and proper learning rate scheduling
3. **Dataset Size**: Limited to 1,500 examples due to memory constraints, but this was sufficient for LoRA
4. **Evaluation**: Used lm-eval harness for standardized benchmarking on ARC-Easy"

### **5. "How did you evaluate the model's performance?"**

**Your Answer:**
"I used the lm-eval framework to evaluate on ARC-Easy benchmark, which tests grade-school level science reasoning. I compared:
- Base Mistral-7B model performance
- Fine-tuned model performance
- Used both raw accuracy and normalized accuracy metrics
- The 1.39% improvement shows the fine-tuning was effective despite the small dataset"

### **6. "What would you do differently if you had more resources?"**

**Your Answer:**
"With more resources, I would:
1. **Larger Dataset**: Use the full Alpaca dataset (52K examples) or multiple datasets
2. **Higher Rank**: Experiment with larger LoRA ranks (32, 64)
3. **More Epochs**: Train for more epochs with better regularization
4. **Multiple Benchmarks**: Evaluate on MMLU, HellaSwag, GSM8K for comprehensive assessment
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search for optimal learning rates and LoRA parameters"

## üéØ Sample Technical Questions & Responses

### **Q: "What's the difference between LoRA rank 16 vs 32?"**
**A:** "Higher ranks capture more complex adaptations but increase parameters and training time. Rank 16 is often a sweet spot - sufficient expressiveness without overfitting. I chose 16 based on common practices for 7B models."

### **Q: "Why use AdamW optimizer?"**
**A:** "AdamW combines Adam's adaptive learning rates with proper weight decay. It's particularly effective for transformer training and handles the sparse updates in LoRA well."

### **Q: "How do you prevent overfitting with small datasets?"**
**A:** "I used early stopping implicitly by training only 2 epochs, gradient clipping, and LoRA's inherent regularization through low-rank constraints. The rank limitation acts as a bottleneck preventing overfitting."
